  <p>We recently received funding from NSF to explore the response of surface uplift to shortening in central Nevada during the early Cretaceous, and are actively recruiting a graduate student to start on this work.</p>
  <p>Collaborators: Sean Long (WSU); Josh Bonde (UNLV); Peter Druscke (Exxon); Dick Hilton (Sierra College)</p>

    alt="Newark project group" width="400px"/>
  <p>This is an ongoing study funded through the Earth-Life Transitions program at NSF, to explore the relative roles of climate or internal ecosystem structure in driving biologic changes in the Great Plains during the Neogene. Specific biologic changes include expansion of C4 grasslands and small mammal faunal changes.</p>
  <p>Collaborators: David Fox (UMN); Kena Fox-Dobbs (U. of Puget Sound); Pratigya Polissar (Lamont); Kevin Uno (Lamont); Bill Lukens (Baylor); Bob Martin (Murray State)</p>
