<h2 class="text-center">CU Boulder Earth Systems Stable Isotope Lab</h2>
<br/>
<br/>

#### Welcome to the CUBES-SIL!

This new lab facility is currently in the planning/renovation stage. We expect construction to begin in mid-February 2016, and instruments to be delivered in May, 2016. So stay tuned for updates!

In the meantime, here are some details on the planned facility. Primary instrumentation at the outset will include two magnetic sector, gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometers:

 (1) a Thermo MAT 253+ for high-precision, dual inlet analysis of multiply-substituted (“clumped”) isotopologues of CO<sub>2</sub>.

 (2) a Thermo Delta V with EA, Gasbench and TCEA for continuous flow analysis of C,H,N,O and S stable isotopes from a range of sample materials.

In addition, the facility will house equipment for sample processing including solid sample preparation, and custom-made on-line and off-line vacuum extraction systems.
