<h2 class="text-center">CU Boulder Earth Systems Stable Isotope Lab</h2>
<br/>
<br/>

#### Welcome to the CUBES-SIL!

This new lab facility is currently in the planning/renovation stage. We expect construction to begin in January 2016, and instruments to be delivered in May, 2016. So stay tuned for updates!

In the meantime, here are some details on the planned facility. Primary instrumentation will include two magnetic sector, gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometers for:

 (1) high-precision dual inlet stable isotope analysis of multiply-substituted (“clumped”) isotopologues of CO<sub>2</sub>.

 (2) C,H,N,O and S continuous flow stable isotope analysis of solids and gases by headspace sampling, online combustion and high temperature conversion elemental analysis.

In addition, the facility will house equipment for sample processing including solid sample preparation, and custom-made on-line and off-line vacuum extraction systems.

Any questions? Please contact Katie Snell or Brett Davidheiser-Kroll
